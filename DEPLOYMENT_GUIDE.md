# 🚀 BETA LAUNCH DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Deploy Security Rules Before Launch

Your Firebase project is currently in **TESTING MODE**, which means **ANYONE can read/write to your database**. This is a major security risk that must be fixed before beta launch.

## 🔒 Step 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules

### Option A: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

4. **Deploy Security Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### Option B: Using Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. Copy the contents of `firestore.rules`
5. Paste into the rules editor
6. Click **Publish**

## 🔐 Step 2: Verify Security Rules

After deployment, test that your rules are working:

1. **Test as Regular User**:
   - Try to access admin-only collections
   - Should be denied access

2. **Test as Admin User**:
   - Login with admin account
   - Should be able to access admin functions

3. **Test Contact Form**:
   - Submit a contact form as guest
   - Should work (anyone can create submissions)
