Ticket Booking: Tickets become available every Thursday at the transport office located behind the laundry shop.
Payment: Only cash is accepted.
Rs. 350 for Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar

Student Mess Halls
There are designated mess halls for each hostel. The food is served at specific times, and the menu is a mix of Pakistani cuisines, rotating on a weekly basis.
- Breakfast: 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM
- Lunch: 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM
- Dinner: 7:30 PM - 9:30 PM

Other Eateries on Campus
For snacks, late-night cravings, or just a different taste, you can explore:
- Hot and Spicy: Located at TUC. By far the best fast food you can find in GIKI.
- Ayan and Raju for Desi: Also located at TUC. These restaurants offer a wide variety of Pakistani cuisine and fast food, but they lack the feel (the hygiene and taste).
- GIKI Cafe: Owned and run by GIKI admin. Itâ€™s located under the auditorium (yes, that circular building you see almost everywhere). It's somewhat similar to the mess in terms of taste and hygiene. It's good for tea and some light snacks like nuggets, samosas, or rolls.

Academics and Stress Management

Dealing with Homesickness
Homesickness is a normal feeling for many freshmen. Getting involved in societies, sports, or other campus activities can help you feel more at home. Regular video calls with family and friends can also help. Don't be afraid to talk to your Resident Advisor (RA) or a senior student about how you feel.

Essential Apps for a GIKI Student
