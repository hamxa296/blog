# üñºÔ∏è Image Upload Feature for Blog Posts

## Overview
The blog post editor (`write.html`) now supports both URL input and direct image upload functionality. Users can either paste an image URL or upload an image directly from their device to Cloudinary.

## Features

### ‚úÖ **Dual Input Options**

### ‚úÖ **Technical Specifications**

- **Storage**: Images uploaded to Cloudinary CDN
- **Database**: Only the Cloudinary URL is stored (no database changes needed)

## How It Works

### 1. **URL Input (Default)**

- No upload required
- Instant validation

### 2. **File Upload**
1. User clicks "Upload Image" tab
2. Drag & drop or click to select file
3. File is validated (type & size)
4. Upload to Cloudinary with progress tracking
5. Cloudinary returns secure URL
6. URL is automatically used in post submission

### 3. **Database Integration**

## User Experience

### **Visual Feedback**

- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed uploads

### **Responsive Design**

## Technical Implementation

### **Cloudinary Configuration**
```javascript
const cloudName = "dfkpmldma";
const uploadPreset = "giki-chronicles";
const url = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${cloudName}/image/upload`;
```

### **File Validation**
- **Type Check**: `file.type.startsWith('image/')`
- **Size Check**: `file.size <= 10 * 1024 * 1024` (10MB)

### **Upload Process**
1. FormData creation with file and preset
2. POST request to Cloudinary API
3. Progress simulation (Cloudinary doesn't provide real-time progress)
